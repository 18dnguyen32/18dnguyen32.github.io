      The purpose of the game Crossy Mario is to help me develope the ability
      to create games on scratch and to introduce me to the thinking behind 
      programming. The crucial process that was involved in this game includes
      the checking of boolean values as presented in script "gamestart" and the 
      the recognition of a data value and its interchangeable nature presented
      in the scripts of every bullets in the game. Without using such process, 
      the game would not be able to continue through time or show the player's
      level and score. However, the difficluties that were presented in game 
      include the overlapping of many stages in the game, which was resolved 
      using the broadcast and receive functionality of Scratch itself. Since the
      game Piano, much of my ability to make a fucntional scratch game has been 
      improved with the use of a more substantial amount of sprites, backgrounds,
      as well as the use of logic to improve what my newest game has to offer.
