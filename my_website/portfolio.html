      The purpose of the game Crossy Mario is to help me develope the ability
      to create games on scratch and to introduce me to the thinking behind 
      programming. The crucial process that was involved in this game includes
      the checking of boolean values as presented in script "gamestart" and the 
      the recognition of a data value and its interchangeable nature presented
      in the scripts of every bullets in the game. Without using such process, 
      the game would not be able to continue through time or show the player's
      level and score. However, the difficluties that were presented in game 
      include the overlapping of many stages in the game, which was resolved 
      using the broadcast and receive functionality of Scratch itself. Since the
      game Piano, much of my ability to make a fucntional scratch game has been 
      improved with the use of a more substantial amount of sprites, backgrounds,
      as well as the use of logic to improve what my newest game has to offer.

      The protagonist Leeroy Jenkins faces many options that decides his fate in 
      the Revolutionary War. His ethics and morals are challenged as he carry 
      orders from his commander.
      
      The story requires a process of planning ahead the plots, characters, and
      backgrounds of the story on a flow chart. The concepts that were required
      complete the story successfully are the time functions in python libraries
      and the boolean checking process of if, elif, and else. The problem that
      appeared was that of the implementation of ASCII characters, which required
      precise spacing and skipline commands. This work allows one to be creative 
      while helping their skills on basic Python conditions of boolean values. 
      One story from the gallery walk that stood out was the one titled "Cynical," 
      which is impressively long and has a compelling language of story-telling.
      If I can do this again, I would make the story longer and put out less text 
      for players to read."
